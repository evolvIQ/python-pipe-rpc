"""XML-RPC/JSON-RPC over file handles (pipes, SSH tunnels, TCP sockets, etc)

Example (client):
-----------------

    proc = streamrpc.Popen(["ssh","myserver","python", "server.py"], 
       stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    
    rpc = streamrpc.XmlClient(process=proc, path=path)
    rpc.my_method("Some","Args")

Example (server):
-----------------

    def my_method(arg1, arg2):
       ...
    
    rpc = streamrpc.Server()
    rpc.register_function(my_method)
    rpc.serve_forever()
